Creating todoist todos from tripit trips
========================================

The basic idea here is that for upcoming work trips, the set of things I need
to do to prepare is fairly predictable, and those things could be todo items
in the todo manager system I use (called todoist).

Unfortunately, there are a few warts. The tripit API is a dumpster fire of
abandonware, and doesn't work with python3. I looked at porting it, but when
I got to the point of needing to debug authentication headers I realized I
didn't care that much.

Of course, the todoist API requires python3 because of its new fangled SSL
certificates.

The solution I came up with was to split the script into two parts -- a scraper
which takes tripit API calls and makes a little cache on disk of upcoming
trips, and a script which uses that cache to write todos to todoist. The
scripts use different versions of python.

Let's get the scraper running first.

Create a ~/.tripit json file, which should look like this:





This script uses trip information from tripit to build todo items in todoist.
The wart here of course is that the tripit API library is terrible, and I had
to forward port it to python3 to get it to work.

To install, do something like:

# cd todoist-python
# pip3 install -e .

I haven't figured out how to get python3 venvs working on Ubuntu 14.04,
apparently Canonical shipped a broken implementation.
